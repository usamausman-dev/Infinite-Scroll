# React Infinite Scroll with Intersection Observer

This React project demonstrates the implementation of the Infinite Scroll feature using the Intersection Observer API. Infinite Scroll is a popular UI pattern where new content is loaded automatically as the user scrolls down the page. The Intersection Observer API is utilized to efficiently detect when an element, in this case, the scroll container, intersects with another element, triggering the loading of additional content.


## Features

- **Infinite Scroll:** New content is loaded seamlessly as the user scrolls down the page, providing a smooth and continuous user experience.

- **Intersection Observer:** The Intersection Observer API is employed to efficiently detect when the scroll container intersects with a predefined loading trigger element.

- **Customizable Loading Indicator:** A customizable loading indicator is displayed while additional content is being fetched, providing visual feedback to the user.
